     <h2>DESCRIPTION OF THE GAMES</h2>
 <dl>
 	<dt>FOOTBALL</dt>
 <dd>Football, also known as soccer in some countries (particularly the United States and Canada), is a team sport played with a round ball, where two teams of eleven players each compete to score goals by getting the ball into the opponent’s goal. It is one of the most popular and widely played sports in the world, enjoyed by millions of people at both recreational and professional levels.

</dd>
      <dt>BADMINTON</dt>
   <dd>Badminton is a fast-paced racquet sport typically played either as a singles game (one player per side) or doubles (two players per side). The objective is to hit a shuttlecock (a feathered projectile) over a net so that it lands in the opponent's side of the court. The shuttlecock must be hit with the racquet and is usually struck so that it flies in a high arc.</dd>
     <dt>LACROSE</dt>
   	<dd>Lacrosse is a fast-paced team sport played with a small rubber ball and a long-handled stick called a crosse. The game involves players using the crosse to catch, carry, and pass the ball in an attempt to score goals by shooting it into the opponent's net.</dd>
      <dt>SWIMMING</dt>
      <dd>Swimming is an Olympic sport with a rich history and is considered one of the most exciting and widely watched events at the Summer Olympics. It is also a major part of the World Aquatics Championships and other international competitions.</dd>
     <dt>VOLLEYBALL</dt>
      <dd>Volleyball is a team sport played by two teams, each typically consisting of six players, who try to score points by sending a ball over a net and into the opponent's court. The game involves both offensive and defensive strategies, with players using their hands and arms to hit, pass, and block the ball.</dd>
      <dt>RUGBY</dt>
      <dd>Rugby is a contact team sport played with an oval-shaped ball, in which two teams compete to score points by carrying, passing, and kicking the ball to the opponent's goal area. The sport originated in England in the 19th century and has since become popular worldwide, particularly in countries such as New Zealand, South Africa, England, Australia, and France.
